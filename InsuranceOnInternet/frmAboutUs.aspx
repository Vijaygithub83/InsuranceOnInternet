    <p> Insurance, in law and economics, is the form of risk management primarily used  <br />
 to hedge against the risk of a contingent loss.  Insurance is defined as the <br />
 equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to another, in exchange <br />
 for a premium, and can be thought of a guaranteed small loss to prevent a large, <br />
 possibly devastating loss.  An insurer is a company selling the insurance. </p>
 <p>The insurance rate is a factor used to determine the amount, called the premium, <br />
 to be charged for a certain amount of insurance coverage. Risk management,the <br />
 practice of appraising and controlling risk, has evolved as a discrete field of study and practice.</p>
